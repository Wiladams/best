Best Environment for Simple Testing

The lj2blend2d repository represents a simple LuaJIT binding to the blend2d vector graphics library.  This repository is the build out of the ever grow list of examples atop that binding.  This repository exists separately because it was becoming too big and involved compared to the simplicity of what is required for testing the blend2d binding, so here it is.

There are two major factions represented here.  One is based on the concept of BEST, which contains a complete windowing environment and UI framework.  The other is p5, which is essentially a Processing like environment.  They share some components such as how to create windows and the like, and they both leverage the core lj2blend2d binding, but they differ in their approaches and the applications you can build with them.

TODO

Create two .exe files
bdesk - BEST desktop environment
bwin  - BEST window environment
